    </ul>

    <p>Step-by-step instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the milk, sugar, egg and yeast.</li>
        <li>Add the bread flour and salt into the mixture and start mixing to form a dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let it rest for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the dough and knead it for 5 to 10 mins until the dough becomes smooth.</li>
        <li>Grease the dough and bowl then cover and rest until the dough doubles in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough rest, in another bowl, add the softened butter, cinnamon powder and brown sugar. Stir everything together until you get a spreadable filling.</li>
        <li>After the dough has doubled, flour your surface to roll the dough on.</li>
        <li>Spread your filling over the rolled dough surface.</li>
        <li>Slice the dough into strips and roll each strip to make the spiral cinnamon rolls.</li>
        <li>Grease your baking tray and place the cinnamon rolls in it. (Make sure to leave gaps between the rolls as they will increase in size after proofing)</li>
        <li>Cover the tray and let it rest for 50 mins or until the rolls double in size.</li>
        <li>Place the baking tray into a preheated 180&deg;C oven for 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Let the cinnamon rolls rest and cool down. During that time, make the frosting.</li>
        <li>To a mixing bowl, add the butter and using a handheld or stand mixer, bear on high speed for 2-3mins, until creamed and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Sift the powdered sugar into the mixing bowl, alongside the vanilla extract and salt.</li>
        <li>Beat on slow speed until everything is incorporated, then beat on high speed for 2-3 mins. Start adding the milk gradually, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Spread the frosting over the cooled cinnamon rolls.</li>
    </ol>
