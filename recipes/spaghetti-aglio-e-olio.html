    <h3>Ingredients for the spaghetti agli-e-olio:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried spaghetti pasta <strong><em>160g</em></strong></li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil <strong><em>3 tbsp</em></strong></li>
        <li>Garlic <strong><em>2 cloves</em></strong></li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes <strong><em>&frac14;tsp</em></strong></li>
        <li>Handful fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>Salt to cook pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step-by-step instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta in a large pot of heavily salted water for 2 minutes under the package instructions and ensure to reserve some pasta water</li>
        <li>At the same time, thinly slice the garlic cloves and chop up the parsley</li>
        <li>In a cold pan, add the olive oil, sliced garlic and red pepper flakes or fresh chilli. Place it on the stove top over low heat</li>
        <li>When the garlic starts to slowly sizzle, add the parsley. Saute together nice and slow, making sure not to burn the garlic</li>
        <li>Pour a ladle of pasta cooking water to the pan and stir together</li>
        <li>When the pasta is almost cooked but still very al dente, drain and add it straight to the pan with another splash of pasta water - increase to medium heat</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta for 2-3 minutes continuously stirring which will emulsify the sauce and become silky and creamy - adding pasta water slowly if it needs it</li>
    </ol>
